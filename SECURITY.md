# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support the latest release of Faros CE for maintenance updates, but depending on the nature of the security issue we may issue hotfixes for arbitrarily earlier versions of Faros CE.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover any issue regarding security, please disclose the information responsibly by sending an email to community+security@faros.ai and **not** by creating a GitHub issue. We'll get back to you ASAP and work with you to confirm and plan a fix for the issue.
